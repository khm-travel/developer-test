# developer-test

A technical skills proficiency for prospective dev team candidates.

> Thank you for taking the time to demonstrate your coding skills. We have created this test to get an idea of your level of proficiency in the LAMP web stack. All code you submit should be your own, and properly cited in comments if it is borrowed.

## Objective

Spend no more than an hour completing select tasks of your choice. Prioritize producing clean, error-free, well documented code over completing everything.

Fork this repo, make your changes and send a link to your public forked repository to development@khmtravel.com

## Tasks

1. Style the form with any method, for example:
- a custom CSS stylesheet
- a SCSS/SASS build
- a frontend framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
2. Validate post request data
3. Save form submissions to a database

## Setup

You will need to run the project on a local or development server. You can use [PHP's built-in web server](https://phptherightway.com/#builtin_web_server) if you do not already have another option.

The [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) should work with PHP out of the box, but you can optionally install the libary if you prefer to interact with the database via CLI. [Resource](https://phptherightway.com/#pdo_extension).

## Evaluation criteria

- Code works (error-free)
- Code is readable, well structured and follows language conventions (clean)
- Code has clear and meaningful comments and meaningful variable/function names (well documented)
- Good user experience (changes contribute to usability of the form)

## Run into issues?

[Create a new issue](https://github.com/khm-travel/developer-test/issues) on the original repo & we'll help to resolve them. Send any questions to development@khmtravel.com.
